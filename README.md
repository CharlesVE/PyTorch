PyTorch Lecture Notes

Here are my lecture notes for PyTorch. In it I have 2 primary tasks completed. 
1 - Creating code that can distinguish between different numbers using the MNIST database.
2 - Creating code that can distinguish between cat and dog images.

I highly recommend watching this video series from 3blue1brown as it has proved invaluable as an introduction to neural networks:
